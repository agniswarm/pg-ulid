"""
Pytest-style tests for ULID casting operations (converted from procedural script).

- Reads DB connection from environment variables (PGHOST, PGDATABASE, PGUSER, PGPASSWORD, PGPORT).
- Fails loudly at collection/runtime if DB connectivity or required ULID functions/types are missing.
- Uses small helper utilities for clarity.
- No skipping: missing pieces cause test failures with actionable messages.
